# Cat Collection & Description Feature for Shopify Dawn Theme

This project introduces a custom feature to the Shopify Dawn theme, adding a specialized section for showcasing a collection of cats for sale and an automatic cat description generator for cats. This feature is designed for pet stores or cat adoption agencies using Shopify to provide detailed, engaging information about their cats.

## Features

- **Cat List Section**: Dynamically displays a list of cats from a specified collection, including details such as breed and price. Supports pagination for easy browsing.
- **Cat Description Section**: Automatically generates a descriptive paragraph about the cat product based on predefined metadata fields such as age, breed, and neuter status.

## Prerequisites

- You have the Shopify Dawn theme installed on your Shopify store. This project builds upon the Dawn theme, integrating additional custom sections for showcasing cats and generating cat descriptions.
- A Shopify admin account with permissions to edit themes and manage products and collections.
- Cats tagged organized into a collection.
- Relevant metadata fields (e.g., breed, age, color) added to cat products.

## Installation

This project is designed as an enhancement to the Shopify Dawn theme, incorporating additional features without replacing the original theme files. Follow these steps to integrate the cat collection and description feature into your existing Dawn theme setup:

1. **Merge Liquid Files**: 
    - The project includes custom Liquid files for the cat list (`cat-list.liquid`) and cat description (`cat-description.liquid`). 
    - Copy these files into the `sections` directory of your Dawn theme. There's no need to remove or alter existing Dawn theme files; these custom sections are designed to complement them.

2. **Update JSON Templates**:
    - The `page.json` and `product.cat.json` configurations provided with this project should be merged with your current Dawn theme's JSON files. 
    - This ensures that the new cat list and cat description sections are registered and can be added to pages and product templates through the Shopify theme editor.

3. **Integrate CSS Styling**:
    - This project comes with additional CSS files (`cat-list.css` and `cat-description.css`) that style the new sections.
    - Link these CSS files in your theme's asset pipeline and ensure they are loaded in your theme layout. This might involve adding `{% stylesheet_tag 'cat-list.css' %}` and `{% stylesheet_tag 'cat-description.css' %}` in your theme.liquid file or an equivalent method based on your theme's structure.

4. **Verify Collection and Metadata**:
    - Ensure you have a collection named "cats" or adjust the section settings in the Shopify theme editor to match your preferred collection's handle.
    - For the cat description feature to work correctly, ensure your cat products have the necessary metadata fields (e.g., breed, age, color) filled in.

## Configuration

### Cat List Section

- **Collection of Cats**: Specify the handle of the collection containing your cat products.
- **Range of Cats**: Set the number of cats to display per page.

### Cat Description Section

- **Custom Description (Optional)**: If you prefer a custom description over the autogenerated one, input it in the section settings.

## Usage

### Displaying the Cat List

Insert the cat list section into any page using the theme editor.

### Adding Cat Descriptions to Products

For each cat product, ensure the relevant metadata fields are filled in to generate the automatic description. The template checks for fields like sex, age, color, breed, and neutered status.

## Customization and Usage

Once installed, you can customize the appearance and settings of these sections through the Shopify theme editor. The cat list and cat description sections are designed for flexibility, allowing you to match them with your store's branding and the unique characteristics of your cat products.
